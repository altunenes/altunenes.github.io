I'm a psychology graduate from Akdeniz University with a deep interest in the intricacies of the mind and visual perception. My lab journey introduced me to a blend of psychological testing, brain-waves, skin conductances, facial electromyography and machine learning. Alongside my studies, I discovered a profound passion for coding with various languages but especially Rust. Outside of my academic and coding endeavors, I enjoy creative coding/algorithmic art, optical illusions, playing electric guitar, watching budgies, and orienteering.
