Actually, when I think about it, I always thought that Gabors would be a great opportunity for a texture, especially for a desert effect, or for sun rays. This can improve a lot over time. For now I tried to create a gabor with a very basic sdf function, you can see the code on shadertoy.
note: play with mouse to adjust orientation.
