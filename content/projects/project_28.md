Track the red ball as it moves, and notice how the gabors seem to shift.

After coding the original effect by following the [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/p6383)  and [Michael Bach's version](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-dottedLines/index.html), I thought that the effect could be strengthened using gabors because effect doesn't work very well on me :-)

but after that, Interestingly, I have discovered a reverse effect when I animate the phase offset. Follow the red dot again, you'll notice that the phase movement stops at some point.
